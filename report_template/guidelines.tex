\subsection*{General info}
\label{sec:general}


\begin{enumerate}
\item  Students in groups of three write a report. We rely on you forming groups.
\item Each group has to choose a method (from the primary book, or from one of the other sourcesbelow) which the members of the group are interested in learning. A case based on a company at which one of the student is doing a master thesis would be an excellent choice.
Otherwise, the group has to find a problem on the internet with data to which to apply their method of choice.
\item Each group has to review an intermediate and near to final version of the report of an other group.
\item The core of the report is at most 10 papes. Appendices are not included, but when long, we (=avv and nvf) will skip them.
\item Each group chooses another group to exchange feedback.
  Each group gives and receives feedback twice, on an intermediate and near final version of the report.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Time lines}


Here is a time line to help you organize your work.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Friday 23/4, 17h: topic choice uploaded to nestor.
  Keep it short, and use this as a start for your intro.
  Please include some motivation about why you chose this topic, why you think it is suitable, and feasible within the course.
  The idea is that we (= avv and nvf) can give you some feedback about whether the topic is good, too simple or too hard.
  Include a phone number on the first page of your report of at least one of you so that we can contact you to give verbal feedback.
\item  Friday 23/4: Aim to have \cref{sec:data-description} written. No upload to nestor.
\item   Friday 30/4, 17h: research proposal uploaded to nestor. \cref{sec:methods-validation} written.  Send it to the other group for feedback.
\item Tuesday 4/5, 17h: intermediate feedback uploaded to nestor. Feedback on intermediate report sent back to the other group.
\item  Friday 7/5 17h:   Mutual feedback discussed.
\item   Friday 28/5 17h: Final version 0.1 uploaded to nestor. Methods implemented and tested, and report nearly finished.
  Ensure you dealt with the feedback.
  Send report to feedback group.
\item Tuesday 1/6, 17h: Final  feedback report uploaded to nestor. Plan a feedback session.
\item  Friday 4/6, 23h59: Final report uploaded to on nestor.
  Ensure again that you dealt with the final feedback.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Include the tex files in your uploads to nestor.
\item Also include the feedback, in the appendix.  We don't include your feedback in the page count of your own report.
\end{enumerate}
